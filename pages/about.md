## About this website
Geophysicists today depend on computational tools for analyzing increasingly large and complex data sets. Over the last 4 years I've benefited greatly from free, open source software and instructional blogs. So I've decided to post some of my own work here!

I make extensive use of [Python](http://www.python.org) in my work. Many of these posts are [iPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which have functioning code that can easily be downloaded and run on your machine. The easiest way to do this is to install [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) software from Enthought. 

Why Python? It's user-friendly, extremely versatile, and there is a tremendous scientific user-community. Furthermore, reproducibility is key to meaningful research, and a suite of Python tools helps enable reproducible work. The developers of iPython have a great [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=F4rFuIb1Ie4) on this topic, or if you prefer is an interesting [article](http://blog.fperez.org/2013/04/literate-computing-and-computational.html) .

## About me
I'm a graduate student pursuing a PhD in [Geological Sciences](http://www.eas.cornell.edu) at Cornell University. Before coming to Cornell, I received a BA Physics degree from [Lewis &amp; Clark College](http://www.lclark.edu/college/departments/physics/) in Portland, OR. I also worked for a year as a Physical Science Technician at the [USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory](http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/) in Vancouver, WA. You can find more information about myself and my research on my department [home page](http://www.geo.cornell.edu/eas/gstudent/sth54/)!
